IoT Based Patient Health Monitoring System using ESP8266 & Arduino. The IoT platform used in this project is ThingSpeak. ThingSpeak is an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) application and API to store and retrieve data from things using the HTTP protocol over the Internet or via a Local Area Network. This IoT device could read the pulse rate and measure the surrounding temperature. It continuously monitors the pulse rate and surrounding temperature and updates them to an IoT platform.

Connections:
The ESP8266 module works with 3.3V only, anything more than 3.7V would kill the module hence be cautious with your circuits. Here is its pins description.

Pin 1: Ground: Connected to the ground of the circuit
Pin 2: Tx/GPIO – 1: Connected to Rx pin of programmer/uC to upload program
Pin 3: GPIO – 2: General purpose Input/output pin
Pin 4 : CH_EN: Chip Enable/Active high
Pin 5: Flash/GPIO – 0: General purpose Input/output pin
Pin 6 : Reset: Resets the module
Pin 7: RX/GPIO – 3: General purpose Input/output pin
Pin 8: Vcc: Connect to +3.3V only

01. Connect Pulse Sensor output pin to A0 of Arduino and other two pins to VCC & GND.
02. Connect LM35 Temperature Sensor output pin to A1 of Arduino and other two pins to VCC      & GND.
03. Connect the LED to Digital Pin 7 of Arduino via a 220-ohm resistor.
04. Connect Pin 1,3,5,16 of LCD to GND.
05. Connect Pin 2,15 of LCD to VCC.
06. Connect Pin 4,6,11,12,13,14 of LCD to Digital Pin12,11,5,4,3,2 of Arduino.
07. The RX pin of ESP8266 works on 3.3V and it will not communicate with the Arduino when we will connect it directly to the Arduino. So, we will have to make a voltage divider for it which will convert the 5V into 3.3V. This can be done by connecting the 2.2K & 1K resistor. Thus the RX pin of the ESP8266 is connected to pin 10 of Arduino through the resistors.
08. Connect the TX pin of the ESP8266 to pin 9 of the Arduino.

Description of ThingSpeak:
ThingSpeak provides a very good tool for IoT based projects. By using the ThingSpeak site, we can monitor our data and control our system over the Internet, using the Channels and web pages provided by ThingSpeak. So first we need to sign up for ThingSpeak and create an account.
Then create a new channel and set up.
Then create the API keys. This key is required for programming modifications and setting your data.
Then upload the code to the Arduino UNO by assembling the circuit shown above. Open the serial monitor and it will automatically connect to Wi-Fi and set up everything.
Now click on channels so that you can see the online data streaming, i.e IoT Based Patient Health Monitoring System using ESP8266 & Arduino.
